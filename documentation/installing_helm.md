## Installing Helm
[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows for the installation or deployment of applications onto a Kubernetes cluster. We can install it as follows:
```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```
To see if Helm has been installed, we can run a simple `helm` command like:
```bash
helm list
```
and we should get an empty table as our output,
| NAME          | NAMESPACE | REVISION  | UPDATED | STATUS  | CHART | APP VERSION |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
|               |           |           |         |         |       |             |
